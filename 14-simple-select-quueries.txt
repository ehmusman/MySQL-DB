we want to change the data type of price in store>product 
its initially VARCHAR
we'll convert it to decimal.

first launch the MySQL Workbench,
select the "store" database by typing, then run the following command.


>> ALTER TABLE products MODIFY price decimal;

then check in phpmyadmin, the unit has been changed.

we can also use letters in lower case 
>> alter table products modify price decimal;
