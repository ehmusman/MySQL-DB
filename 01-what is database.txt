What is DataBase?
Database is an ordered collection of data
a simple notepad file can also be a flat data base.
most of people think database is combination of following three things


1- The Data
2- The Database Management System(DBMS like MySQL is, PostgreeSQL, Mongodb)
3- Database Application(PHP My Admins, MySQL WorkBench are the interfaces to interact with data in the database)


---------------------------------------------------
What is DBMS
DBMS is a software that is designed to modal data and provide interaction with a user.
its may used with a command line or with GUI tools(PHP My Admin).

>> Data is normally stored in one or more files.
>> Data is usually stored in tables.
>> Tables contain rows and columns much like a spreadsheet
>> Data can be cross referenced among tables. This functionality is used in "Relational Database" such as MySQL.


Here are some popular DBMS's

>> MySQL
>> PostgreSQL
>> SQlite
>> Microsoft SQL Server 
>> Oracle
>> SAP 
>> FoxPro
>> dBASE 
>> Mariadb

    Simple Example of DB 


1- Database Name: MyStore
2- Table Name 
3- Columns/Fields: id,firstName,lastName,email
4- Rows/Records: No. of users.

Interacting with a database

when we install MySQL which is a database server we use clients to interact with it whether it is locally or remotely. 

>> some common functions when working with a database 
1- Define 
2- Create 
3- Select 
4- Query 
5- Update 
6- Delete

we can doo all these with a single field, a clump of fields or with tables, 

---------------------------------------------------------------

What is SQL?

SQL Stands for Structured Querry Language
it is a special purpose language that allows the developer to interact with the data in tha database 

>> it is based on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus
>> Data defination and data manipulation languages.
>> can perform CRUD(Create, Read, Updata, Delete)

-------------------------------------------------------------

Common Database Models

>> Relational Database(MySQL)
>> Object Oriented Database
>> Object Relational Database 
>> Distributed Database 
>> NoSQL Database(MongoDB)
>> Multimedia database (to hold videos, images and all stuff like that)
>> Flat Database  (just a file with data in it)
>> Network Database 
>> Hierarchical Database 

We'll focus on the Relational Database
