Relational Model Rules 

Each column value must be a single value only.
All values for a given column must be of the same data type.
Each column name must be unique.
The order of columns is insignificant
No two rows in a relation can be identical.
The order of the rows is insignificant.

Functional Dependency

A Functional Dependency describes a relationship between columns within a single relation.

A column is dependent on another if one value can be used to determine the value of another.

Example: first_name is functionally dependent on id because id can be used to uniquely determine the value of first_name

COMMON DESIGN MISTAKES

Tables with too many fields or with fields that do not relate to each other
Too many tables with similar data
Repeated rows
Using comma separated values or multiple values in a single row 
Poor naming conventions
Poor or no planning
Non-Normalized data

---------------------------------------------------------------------

DATABASE NORMALIZATION

Normalization is the process of organizing the fields and tables of a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependency

This can involve dividing larger tables into smaller tables and defining relationships between them. 

The objective is to isolate data so that actions in a field can be made in one table and then propagated through the rest of the needed tables using properly defined relationships.
