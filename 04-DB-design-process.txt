Design Process 

All developers should have some kind or process when creating a database/application structure, especially with relational databases. Processes may vary depending on the developer. .


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step one: Define Your Purpose

The first step is to define the purpose of your database and the application(s) that will use it

Our purpose is pretty simple. We want to create a database for an application/website that will 

Sell products which can be categorized
Create customer accounts
Allow customers to create reviews for products
Provide a basic content management system for static pages

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Step Two: Determine Your Table.

Once we figure out our purpose and what kinds of tasks we need to do, we can divide our information up into tables. You should follow a naming convention in your table structure.

Going by the defining process, we know we need the following tables…

    product_categories
    products
    customers
    reviews
    page_categories
    pages
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step Three: Determining Your Fields 

Your tables need fields. First decide which information you want to save, then decide which table it should be placed in

This step also includes choosing data types. We will map out our full structure in the next video

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step Four: Determining Your Relationships

In this step, we need to look at our table data and figure out which tables can relate to another

A good example is in our “reviews” table, we have a “customer” field. This field will relate to the “id” field in the “customers” table


------------------------------------------------------------------

Step Five: Create a diagram 

Now that you have your data structure figured out, transfer it from a messy notepad file to a neat diagram or some other physical representation of the schema using software like MySQL Workbench or Dia Diagram Editor


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Step Six: Refine If Needed

In step five you want to take a step back and really look at your data structure and make any additions or changes needed

Don’t get worried if you forgot some things or made any errors. Your initial design is like a rough draft. You can improve things as your application grows.
