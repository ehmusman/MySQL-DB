Design Process 

Normalization is the process of organizing the fields and tables of a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependency

This can involve dividing larger tables into smaller tables and defining relationships between them. 

The objective is to isolate data so that actions in a field can be made in one table and then propagated through the rest of the needed tables using properly defined relationships.
